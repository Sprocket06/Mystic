Hi there! This is a *highly* experimental rpg-like game/prototype/thing I work on in my free time. 

## Todo List
- [x] bindings for cute_c2 collisions stuff
- [x] simple collision test
- [x] demonstration of extra information from collision manifolds
- [x] simple "collide and stop" collision resolution
- [ ] Add more stuff to this list KEK
- [ ] Fancy animation for HP/MP decrease/increase.
- [ ] Skill bar
- [ ] Skill system
- [ ] Cooldown animation for skill bar
